# The Galaxy Boy (galaxy-run-handheld)
#### By Zach Mahan, Puqi Luo, & Ivan Outkine, created for the Brown ENGN0030 Design Module
   The Galaxy Boy is inspired from the Nintendo Game Boy. We have designed it to be an ultra-portable, on-the-go gaming machine. It consists of a 3D printed tablet with an embedded 16x2 LCD screen and two buttons—A and B—that control the game. The game, titled Galaxy Run, can be described as an endless runner: the user controls a spaceship that must navigate past dangerous chunks of space dust and meteors, with the difficulty increasing as time goes on. Galaxy Run also keeps track of a score, the number of frames the user has survived for, to encourage longer playtimes in order to achieve a higher score. The software also has an easy-to-use reset function when the game is lost, meaning that it is easy to play over and over.
